//energy up to integrator error. h is uniform across both phases, so no grad-h
//(Omega) correction terms are needed for that to hold.
//One non-conservative term remains -- clamping negative pressure to 0 rectifies
//the EOS, pushing particles apart under compression without pulling them back

//antisymmetric and momentum is conserved exactly.
//
//The difference from the global `friction` above is what makes it useful here:
//Pi_ij is nonzero ONLY for pairs that are APPROACHING each other. It therefore
//dissipates relative motion -- acoustic ringing, particle disorder, the noise
//that the non-conservative Mueller force model keeps feeding in -- while a
//uniformly translating blob (a falling drop, a sloshing pool) has no
//approaching pairs and is left essentially untouched. `friction` cannot make
//that distinction: it damps the drop and the noise at the same rate.

//          typically runs alpha ~ 0.01-0.1. alpha = 1.0 is the classic shock
//          value and would be heavily over-damped here. Set 0 to disable.
//  beta  : quadratic term, suppresses particle interpenetration at high Mach.
//          The flow here is Mach ~ 6.5/80 = 0.08, so 0 is fine; use beta = 2*alpha
//          if fast particles start passing through each other.
